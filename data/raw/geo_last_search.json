Dissected aortas were subjected to scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) to determine single-cell changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. DAPA treatment conferred effective glycemic control in db/db mice, with significant reduction in blood glucose/hemoglobin A1c. scRNA and scATAC-seq analysis of aortas identified major cell populations, including SMC, fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells. SMC were further clustered into 9 subtypes, including contractile and fibromyocyte-like cells.

Although clinicians routinely prioritize glycemic control before initiating implant-related treatment plans, diabetic patients often exhibit impaired osseointegration.

Here, integrating RNA-seq, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq analyses, we demonstrate that stringent glycemic control in type I diabetes fails to normalize fatty-acid biosynthetic process, which remain persistently activated and potentiate macrophage-mediated inflammation and osteoclastogenesis when experiencing the secondary challenge. Mechanistically, prior hyperglycemic exposure enhances chromatin accessibility and sustaining Acsl1 transcription by H3K4me1 epigenetic modification at the Acsl1 locus in macrophages. This epigenetic imprint augments fatty-acid anabolism, amplifies pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and accelerates osteoclastic differentiation, ultimately compromising osseous repair. Collectively, our findings reveal that diabetes-induced H3K4me1 modification at Acsl1 drives metabolic reprogramming underpinning trained immunity and consequent bone damage.

      "summary": "Hypoxia drives diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression through Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) signaling. The kidney\u2019s cellular heterogeneity and complex architecture pose challenges for directly assessing the pharmacologic effects on kidney oxygenation and hypoxia responsive pathways in vivo, such as treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), presumed to impact kidney oxygenation. Using single-cell transcriptional profiling of kidney tissue from youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who showed minimal clinical evidence of DKD, we identified cell type enrichment of HIF regulated genes, findings that replicated in people with later stage DKD in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Using conserved transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, higher-order promoter regulatory structures identified potential cooperating TFs that explained the cell type enrichment pattern. From these promoter elements, 7 interconnected regulatory pathways were identified, comprising a network of 237 genes.  Analysis of multiome data from reference tissue in KPMP demonstrated that 80% of the network genes resided in accessible chromatin. Expression of network genes increased significantly in late compared to early stage DKD and were validated in a hypoxic human organoid model system. Kidney tissue from individuals with T2D treated with SGLT2i demonstrated reversal of the accumulated changes in the HIF network compared to those not treated with SGLT2i. Most high confidence genes showed concordant differential expression in spatial transcriptomics from individuals with T2D.  Hypoxic kidney organoids treated with SGLT2i confirmed these protective effects. Our promoter-anchored HIF regulatory network provides a multi-component read-out that captures disease progression and quantifies therapeutic response to SGLT2i.",

      "summary": "Background: Though it is acknowledged that ischemia reperfusion injury is the primary pathology of cold storage associated kidney transplantation, its underlying mechanism is not well elucidated. Method: To extend the understanding of molecular event and mine hub genes post-transplantation, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing at different time points (24h, day7 and 14) on a murine kidney transplantation model with prolonged cold storage (10h). Result: In the present study, we showed that genes related to regulation of apoptotic process, DNA damage response, cell cycle/proliferation and inflammatory response were steadily elevated at 24h and day7. The upregulated gene profiling delicately transformed to extracellular matrix organization and fibrosis at day 14. It is prominent that metabolic associated genes persistently took the first place among downregulated genes. The gene ontology terms of particular note to enrich are fatty acid oxidation and mitochondria energy metabolism. Correspondingly, the key enzymes of the above processes were the products of hub genes as recognized. Moreover, we highlighted the proximal tubular cell specific increased genes at 24h by combining the data with public RNA-seq performed on proximal tubules. We also focused on ferroptosis related genes and fatty acid oxidation genes to show profound gene dysregulation in kidney transplantation. Conclusion: The comprehensive characterization of transcriptomic analysis may help provide diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in kidney transplantation.",

      "summary": "Diabetes affects over half a billion people worldwide, with cardiovascular disease Q7 being its leading cause of death, either occurring secondary to atherosclerosis or due to an intrinsic defect in heart muscle (diabetic cardiomyopathy, DbCM). One instigator for DbCM is impaired cardiac metabolism characterized by excessive fatty acid (FA) delivery and utilization by the heart, causing oxidative stress and toxic lipid accumulation. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) has been shown to counter these factors associated with abnormal cardiac metabolism by inducing metabolic flexibility and preventing cardiac lipid accumulation in Type 2 diabetes. However, its impact on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and the sources of FA for cardiac use in Type 1 diabetes is unknown. Global Vegfb knockout (VegfbKO) in rats caused limited phenotype and cardiac transcriptome changes under normal conditions but notably reduced cardiac LPL activity, probably by impeding LPL translocation from cardiomyocyte to the coronary vasculature. Under streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, VegfbKO rats exhibited increased cardiac LPL activity, protecting animals from dyslipidemia, decreased plasma saturated FA, and provided a safer cardiac FA source, LPL-derived FA. Knockout of Vegfb also protected animals from DbCM by inhibiting excess FA oxidation, preserving angiogenesis and alleviating cell death in the heart. Inhibiting VEGFB may offer a promising therapeutic approach to address the current lack of mechanism-based treatments for DbCM.",

      "summary": "Antigen\u2010specific immunotherapies aim to induce peripheral tolerance in autoreactive T cells without the collateral risks of broad immunosuppression. In type 1 diabetes, certain class II HLA molecules strongly predict disease risk, indicating the centrality of CD4 T cell epitopes in disease. However, CD8 T cells targeting islet-antigens are predominant in human islet infiltrates and critical for disease progression. Understanding how peripheral tolerance induction to CD4 peptide autoantigens can generate the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T cells is still not entirely understood.  Here, we show that nanoparticles conjugated to a single CD4 T cell epitope, a hybrid insulin peptide, can reshape the fate of antigen\u2010specific CD8 T cells in islet grafts. Induction of tolerance arrested the functional differentiation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells and restricted their TCR repertoire towards a lower\u2010avidity public TCR. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells are arrested in part by the expansion of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing antigen-specific CD4 regulatory populations that function through indirect suppression of dendritic cell licensing in grafts. Neutralization of IL-10 during hybrid insulin peptide tolerance induction abrogates graft protection, restores CD8 effector differentiation and TCR affinity, and rescues dendritic cell licensing, establishing an IL-10 dependent suppression axis. These findings help explain how antigen\u2010specific therapy to a single CD4 hybrid insulin peptide epitope can arrest autoreactive CD8 T cell effector fates in transplanted islets, prolonging graft survival.",

      "summary": "Podocyte lipid accumulation has emerged as an important driver during the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain not fully clarified. Here, we identified the histone methyltransferase NSD2 as a key epigenetic regulator of podocyte lipid accumulation and injury in DKD. NSD2 expression is markedly increased in podocytes from both DKD patients and mouse models, and its levels shows a positive correlation with disease severity. Genetic deletion of Nsd2 in podocytes, as well as pharmacological inhibition of its methyltransferase activity, substantially reduced podocyte injury and proteinuria in mouse models. In contrast, transgenic Nsd2 overexpression in podocytes aggravated these pathological alterations. Mechanistically, elevated NSD2 in DKD enhances H3K36me2 deposition at the Ajuba promoter, resulting in its transcriptional upregulation and subsequent suppression of Hippo signaling. This epigenetic change promotes lipid accumulation in podocytes, leading to cytoskeletal disturbances and increased apoptosis. Collectively, our findings reinforce lipid accumulation as a central contributor to DKD progression and indicate that NSD2, as a pivotal epigenetic regulator in this process, could represent a reasonable therapeutic target for DKD.",
