GSE317266,Energy-sensing molecule RORγ regulates Cholesterol Metabolism and Immune Signaling in Diabetic Kidney Disease and Aging,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,6,317266,,2026/01/22,"Aging is a major risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), with both conditions exhibiting similar renal pathology. We identify the energy-sensing molecule Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) as significantly downregulated in diabetic and aged kidneys. Tubule-specific RORγ deficiency exacerbates kidney injury, whereas its overexpression protects. Mechanistically, RORγ stabilizes insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) by upregulating the deubiquitinase YOD1 and enhancing AMPK activity via CAB39, which together promote INSIG1 phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization. Stabilized INSIG1 potently blocks the ER-to-Golgi transport and activation of SREBP2 (cholesterol synthesis) and STING (inflammatory signaling). In diabetes, RORγ itself is suppressed transcriptionally by CTCF and functionally by impaired AMPK/SIRT1 signaling, which hinders its activation. Importantly, administration of a RORγ agonist or RORγ-enriched exosomes effectively alleviates diabetic kidney injury. Thus, RORγ emerges as a key regulatory node that mitigates DKD and renal aging by co-regulating AMPK-mediated metabolic and STING-driven innate immune pathways through INSIG1 stabilization."
GSE309688,Natural daylight during office hours improves glucose control and whole-body substrate metabolism,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,48,309688,,2026/01/06,"Chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). In a randomized cross-over design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with T2D were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted towards a greater reliance on fat oxidation upon daylight. In vitro assessment of the muscle clock displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure during office hours has a positive metabolic impact in individuals with T2D and could potentially support the treatment of metabolic diseases."
GSE311535,RNA-seq of human atherosclerotic carotid plaque tissue from diabetic patients,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,12,311535,,2025/12/17,"Diabetes Mellitus is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarctions and strokes due to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development and rupture. The mechanisms driving plaque rupture in the diabetic setting remain unclear. We sequenced ribosome-depleted total RNA from carotid plaques obtained from diabetic subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy with high-grade stenosis, who either recently experienced a carotid-related ischemic cerebrovascular event (Symptomatic, n=6) or had no such event (Asymptomatic, n=6). Principal component analysis of the most variable transcripts demonstrated that sex and insulin use, rather than plaque rupture status, were the major contributors to the variability in the dataset. Hierarchical clustering further highlighted the importance of these factors in the dataset but also included two clusters whose expression was elevated in the symptomatic group. These clusters were enriched with transcripts for immunoglobulins and matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting increased B-cell infiltration and extracellular matrix degradation in the symptomatic plaques. We identified only two transcripts, RNU2-1 and PI4KAP1, as significantly up-regulated in the symptomatic group. We identified 35 transcripts with altered expression in subjects on insulin therapy, including regulators of B-cells (MZB1), T cells (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3, CD96, and CTSW), and macrophages (MPEG1). Next, we used spatial deconvolution to focus on differentially expressed genes in the fibrous cap of the carotid plaques. In the symptomatic group, we identified elevated levels of five angiogenesis-associated transcripts (ALS2CL, EPHB4, SMAD1, PREX2, EFNA5), suggesting increased intraplaque neovascularization in ruptured plaques. Thus, insulin use significantly impacts the transcriptome of atherosclerotic plaques, promoting vascular inflammation."
GSE260717,Proteogenomic discovery of novel open reading frames with HLA immune presentation on human beta cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,18,260717,,2025/12/09,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) provides a comprehensive view of translational regulation, crucial for understanding cellular processes. Here, we applied Ribo-seq to map the translatome of human stem cell-derived beta cells (sBCs). Our analysis revealed close to 1000 novel open reading frames (nuORFs) in sBCs, with a majority showing protein-level support, suggesting functional relevance. Furthermore, we detected an immunogenic peptide, INS-DRiP, originating from an alternative start site in INS mRNA. Comparison with primary human islets highlighted beta cell specificity of the identified nuORFs. Notably, we identified a regulatory upstream ORF within TYK2, a gene implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and crucial for beta cell function and interferon response. Our findings underscore the importance translational regulation in beta cell function and its implications in T1D."
GSE311533,Lamin A/C regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation: insights from models of familial partial lipodystrophy 2 sub1,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,14,311533,,2025/12/01,"Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, and metabolic dysfunction. FPLD2 is caused by pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear lamins A/C, structural proteins that control nuclear function and gene expression. However, the mechanisms driving adipocyte loss in FPLD2 remain poorly defined. In this study, we recruited eight families with developing or established FPLD2 and performed clinical, histological, and transcriptomic analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed suppression of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways, alongside increased inflammation. These signatures were mirrored in tamoxifen-inducible adipocyte-specific Lmna knockout mice, in which lamin A/C-deficient adipocytes shrank and disappeared. Lmna-deficient fibroblasts shared similar gene expression changes, linked to altered chromatin accessibility, underscoring lamin A/C’s potential regulatory role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory programs. By directly comparing atrophic and hypertrophic adipose depots in FPLD2, and integrating human, mouse, and in vitro models, this study provides new insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets."
GSE273001,Integrative RNA-seq and CLIP-seq analysis reveals hnRNP-F regulation of the TNFα/NFκB signaling in high glucose conditions,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Unclear,True,supplementary,6,273001,,2025/11/13,"Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq we found that we found that hnRNP-F may bind to lncRNA SNHG1 to negatively regulate the transcription of genes involved in the TNFα/NFκB signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Our study suggests that hnRNP-F may play a role in diabetic nephropathy by regulating the differential expression and variable splicing of diabetic nephropathy-associated genes, especially those related to inflammatory response."
GSE281598,Gastric Bypass Elicits Persistent Gut Adaptation and Unique Diabetes Remission-Related Metabolic Gene Regulation,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,56,281598,,2025/11/11,"Abstract: Objective: We have previously shown that early intestinal adaptation precedes and relates to metabolic improvement in humans after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). We hypothesized that intestinal adaptation would persist at the one-year postoperative timepoint, and that gene expression (GE) signatures would relate to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission, providing insight into potential mechanisms for intestinally-mediated metabolic improvement after RYGB. Methods: We determined GE by RNA-seq in jejunum (Roux limb, RL) collected from 28 patients before and 12 months after RYGB. Results: Global GE from paired baseline and 1-year jejunal samples did not separate according to clinical phenotype (T2D remission, sustained weight loss). In general, GE was consistent with persistent RL remodeling, and microvilli were elongated by 39%. Remodeling was not attenuated in patients with lack of diabetes remission or with weight regain. Patients with diabetes remission demonstrated greater jejunal activation of lipogenesis-related pathways driven by RXR, LXR and SREBP. Conclusions: RL adaptation is a key feature of RYGB in all patients, likely reflecting the dramatic alterations to gastrointestinal anatomy, but jejunal lipogenesis appears to be more strongly activated in those patients with diabetes remission. Further study is needed to understand whether these pathways may drive metabolic remission after RYGB."
GSE305251,Lactyl-HDAC1-Mediated Epigenetic Gating of Angiogenic Transcription via Metabolic Reprogramming [RNA-seq],Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,6,305251,,2025/11/04,"While angiogenesis serves as a cornerstone of embryogenesis and a defining feature of pathological progression, a critical gap persists in understanding how metabolic signaling precisely converges with nuclear reprogramming to ignite vascular growth. Here, we demonstrate that glucose-derived lactate via glycolysis induces site-specific lactylation at lysine 412 (K412) of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), triggering transcriptional activation of pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGFA. Mechanistically, HDAC2 forms a nuclear complex with HDAC1 to suppress its lactylation modification in the cytoplasm, whereas alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) promotes its lactylation in cytoplasm to prevent HDAC1 nuclear translocation, leading to nuclear accumulation of H3K56 acetylation and chromatin remodeling that selectively activates angiogenesis-related transcriptional programs. In zebrafish models, HDAC1-K412 mutation caused embryonic lethality, and site-specific lactylation dynamically increased during cardiac development. In the HDAC1 K412A mutation knock-in mouse model, the results showed that this site prevents vascular proliferation in the retinas of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Pharmacologically, we found that the HDAC1 activator Exifone suppressed its lactylation and inhibited vascular growth. Strikingly, Exifone attenuates pathological neovascularization in embryonic chick models and halts aberrant vascular proliferation within the retinal vasculature of STZ-diabetic mice. Our findings reveal HDAC1 lactylation as a metabolic-epigenetic nexus governing angiogenesis, providing mechanistic insights into not only obscures developmental principles but hampers therapeutic targeting of aberrant vascularization in diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes."
GSE279804,High-Yield Extruded Nanovesicles from Adipose Stem Cells Promote High-quality Healing of Diabetic Wound through WNT/beta-Catenin Pathway Activation.,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,8,279804,,2025/10/23,"Diabetes is a significant global chronic disease characterized by elevated mortality and disability rates due to persistent infections resulting from refractory wounds. Currently, effective treatment strategies are lacking. Adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles (ADSC-EVs) have been shown to promote skin wound healing; however, their clinical application is impeded by low yield and heterogeneity. We successfully isolated high-yield extruded nanovesicles from adipose stem cells (ADSC-NVs), achieving yields over 30 times greater than those of ADSC-EVs while maintaining similar morphological characteristics. Our findings indicate that ADSC-NVs exhibit a dose-dependent enhancement of proliferation and migration in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) in vitro. Notably, the expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), collagen type I (COL-I), and collagen type III (COL-III) were significantly upregulated in HDF following treatment with ADSC-NVs. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between the ADSC-NVs group and control group were predominantly enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway. Consistently, ADSC-NVs facilitate efficient diabetic wound healing while promoting proliferation and inhibiting inflammation via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, high-yield ADSC-NVs represent a promising alternative to ADSC-EVs for enhancing diabetic wound healing, providing novel insights and methodologies for improving therapeutic outcomes."
GSE303983,Molecular responses in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue after a session of endurance exercise: effects of exercise intensity,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Unclear,True,supplementary,90,303983,,2025/10/21,"The primary aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of three exercise intensities on abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT) transcriptome in regular exercisers. A total of 45 adults who exercise regularly were assigned to perform a single session of either low-intensity continuous (LOW; 60min at 30% VO2max; n=15), moderate-intensity continuous (MOD; 45min at 65% VO2max; n=15), or high-intensity interval exercise (HIGH; 10x1min at 90% VO2max interspersed with 1min active recovery; n=15). aSAT biopsy samples were collected before and 1.5hours after the exercise session for bulk RNA sequencing and targeted protein immunoassays. HIGH upregulated genes involved in cytokine secretion, insulin signaling, and proteolysis while MOD and LOW upregulated genes regulating ECM remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Exercise-induced changes in aSAT angiogenic, MAPK cascade, and clock genes, ERK protein phosphorylation, and circulating cytokines were similar after all three exercise treatments. Network analysis identified exercise-responsive gene clusters linked to cardiometabolic health traits. Cell-type analysis highlighted a heterogeneous response of aSAT cell types to exercise, with distinct patterns observed across exercise intensities. Collectively, our data characterizes early responses in aSAT after a single session of exercise. Because adaptations to exercise training stem from an accrual of responses after each session of exercise, these early responses to exercise are likely important contributors to the long-term structural and functional changes that occur in adipose tissue in response to exercise training."
GSE308951,A platelet transcriptomic signature of thromboinflammation predicts cardiovascular risk,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,38,308951,,2025/10/20,"The CHOlesterol Reduction and Residual Risk in type 2 Diabetes (CHORD) study was a prospective study that investigated the effect of lipid lowering therapieis in participants with LDL-C >100 mg/dL without cardiovascular disease, off all antiplatelet therapy. Individuals with MPA levels, defined as CD14+CD16+ cells, were measured before and after four weeks of lipid lowering therapy. Patients were categorized as MPAhigh or MPAlow based on consistently high or low MPA levels accross timepoints. MPAhigh individuals exhibited an enrichment of immune signaling pathway. We developed a 42/gene Thromboinflammation Platelet Signature (TIPS), which correlated with MPA levels in multiple cohorts. TIPS was significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial infarction and predicted future cardiovascular events in patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization after a median follow-up of 18 months. Notably, TIPS was modifiable by ticagrelor. These findings introduce TIPS as a novel platelet RNA signature that captures platelet-immune activity and offers a promising tool for cardiovascular risk stratification."

This hydrogel is found to reverse the hyperglycemic inflammatory microenvironment and promote functional tissue regeneration in periodontitis in diabetes.

GSE309294,Human pancreatic ductal cells from non-T1D donors respond to T1D cytokines and function as non-professional antigen presenting cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,12,309294,,2025/09/30,"Aims/Hypothesis: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease marked by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreatic islets, with an incomplete picture of disease pathogenesis/progression and a lack of definitive cure. A recent finding linked pancreatic ductal cells of T1D donors with elevated levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II molecules; however, the causal relationship and functional significance of this finding remain unknown. Because HLA Class II molecules are typically expressed by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), this raises the possibility of ductal cells functioning as non-professional APCs. In this study, we test the hypothesis that non-T1D ductal cells are responsive to T1D-associated proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, and can act as non-professional APCs. Methods: Pancreatic exocrine cells, after the removal of islets, were obtained from cadaveric donors without apparent diseases and with appropriate consent. Cells were cryopreserved, thawed into a defined culture medium tailored to support ductal cell survival in a 3D suspension culture system. Ductal cells were exposed to various doses of cytokines for 48 hours and analyzed for gene and protein expression, using qRT-PCR, bulk-RNAseq, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. Functional ability of cytokine-treated ductal cells to present an exogenous autoantigen (glutamate decarboxylase 65kD isoform [GAD65]) to T cells was tested using a GAD65-specific autoreactive CD4+ T cell clone (named BRI4.13) isolated from a T1D donor. Results: We found that within 48 hours a combination of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ stimulated the expression of HLA Class II, co-stimulatory, and antigen-processing molecules at mRNA and protein levels in non-T1D ductal cells. Bulk RNAseq analysis showed that cytokines most significantly upregulated biological pathways in “antigen processing and presentation” and “T1D”. When cytokine-treated ductal cells were pulsed with an exogenous GAD65 peptide and cocultured with the BRI4.13 T cells, these T cells became activated and proliferated. Unexpectedly, we also found ~1% of KRT19+ ductal cells express GAD protein endogenously. Conclusions/interpretation: These results demonstrate that non-diseased primary ductal cells are sensitive to TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ stimulation, and can upregulate APC molecules and function in antigen presentation to autoreactive CD4+ T cells. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence demonstrating antigen presentation by non-T1D human ductal cells to T cells, which implicate ductal cells in contributing to T1D progression."
GSE290559,Effect of Ref-1 redox inhibition with APX2009 on gene expression in human retinal endothelial cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,10,290559,,2025/09/24,"Ischemic retinopathies, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), are characterized by abnormal retinal neovascularization. Current therapeutic interventions for these diseases include intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF biologics, which face multiple limitations due to variable patient response and utilization of alternative pathways to promote angiogenesis. APE1/Ref-1, a protein with both DNA endonuclease and redox regulatory functions, may be a novel therpautic target for proliferative retinopathies, because the redox function of Ref-1 modulates multiple signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation. Here, we aimed to identify novel signaling pathways regulated by Ref-1 redox activity using RNA sequencing of human retinal endothelial cells treated with Ref-1 redox inhibitor APX2009."
