GSE309688,Natural daylight during office hours improves glucose control and whole-body substrate metabolism,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,48,309688,,2026/01/06,"Chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). In a randomized cross-over design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with T2D were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted towards a greater reliance on fat oxidation upon daylight. In vitro assessment of the muscle clock displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure during office hours has a positive metabolic impact in individuals with T2D and could potentially support the treatment of metabolic diseases."
GSE263483,Effects of intrauterine hyperglycemia on offspring development in gestational diabetes mellitus based on placental transcriptomics,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,16,263483,,2025/12/30,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) refers to diabetes diagnosed as diabetes in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, but not obvious before pregnancy. It is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, which can lead to perinatal asphyxia, neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia, cardiovascular abnormalities, obesity and other short-term and long-term adverse outcomes of the offspring. This study explores the differential expression of transcriptome between GDM and non GDM placenta, and explores the impact of subtle metabolic changes in the placenta on fetal growth and development during GDM in pregnant women."
GSE314698,Pancreatic volume and immunological biomarkers predict checkpoint inhibitor-associated autoimmune diabetes in humans.,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,83,314698,,2025/12/26,"Background: Checkpoint inhibitor-associated autoimmune diabetes (CIADM) is a rare but life-altering complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Biomarkers that predict type 1 diabetes (T1D) are unreliable for CIADM. Aim To identify biomarkers for prediction of CIADM. Methods: From our prospective biobank, 14 CIADM patients who had metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1±anti CTLA4 were identified. Controls were selected from the same biobank, matched 2:1. Pre-treatment, on-ICI and post-CIADM serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed. Serum was analysed for T1D autoantibodies, C-peptide, glucose and cytokines. PBMCs were profiled using flow cytometry. Pancreatic volume was measured using CT volumetry. Results: Before treatment, CIADM patients had smaller pancreatic volume (27% reduction, p=0.044) and higher anti-GAD antibody titres (median 2.9 versus 0, p=0.01). They had significantly higher baseline proportions of Th17 helper cells (p=0.03), higher CD4+ central memory cells (p=0.04) and lower naïve CD4+ cells (p=0.01). With ICI treatment, greater declines in pancreatic volume were seen in CIADM patients (p<0.0001). Activated CD4+ subsets increased significantly in CIADM and controls with immune-related adverse effects (IRAE) but not controls without IRAE. Using only pre-treatment results, pancreatic volume, anti-GAD antibody titre and baseline immune flow profile were highly predictive of CIADM development, with an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.96. Conclusions: People who develop CIADM are immunologically predisposed and have antecedent pancreatic and immunological changes that accurately predict disease with excellent sensitivity. These biomarkers could be used to guide ICI use, particularly when planning treatment for low-risk tumours."
GSE301956,Identification of Circulating miRNA Alterations in Diabetes Patients Excluding Periodontitis Effects: Insights into Target Gene Downregulation in Diabetic Complications,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,43,301956,,2025/12/04,"Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, we analyzed plasma exosomal miRNAs from normal individuals and patients with PD or PD combined with diabetes (PDDM). Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using small RNA-seq, and their target genes were validated using bulk RNA-seq datasets from tissues related to diabetic complications. Analysis of target genes revealed biologically meaningful pathways that were consistently involved across affected tissues, providing insight into systemic miRNA–mRNA regulation in diabetes."
GSE311533,Lamin A/C regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation: insights from models of familial partial lipodystrophy 2 sub1,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,14,311533,,2025/12/01,"Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, and metabolic dysfunction. FPLD2 is caused by pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear lamins A/C, structural proteins that control nuclear function and gene expression. However, the mechanisms driving adipocyte loss in FPLD2 remain poorly defined. In this study, we recruited eight families with developing or established FPLD2 and performed clinical, histological, and transcriptomic analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed suppression of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways, alongside increased inflammation. These signatures were mirrored in tamoxifen-inducible adipocyte-specific Lmna knockout mice, in which lamin A/C-deficient adipocytes shrank and disappeared. Lmna-deficient fibroblasts shared similar gene expression changes, linked to altered chromatin accessibility, underscoring lamin A/C’s potential regulatory role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory programs. By directly comparing atrophic and hypertrophic adipose depots in FPLD2, and integrating human, mouse, and in vitro models, this study provides new insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets."
GSE310542,A single-nucleus dataset sampling subcutaneous white adipose from living donors to study familial partial lipodystrophy 2,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,30,310542,,2025/11/22,"Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, and metabolic dysfunction.

GSE279804,High-Yield Extruded Nanovesicles from Adipose Stem Cells Promote High-quality Healing of Diabetic Wound through WNT/beta-Catenin Pathway Activation.,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,8,279804,,2025/10/23,"Diabetes is a significant global chronic disease characterized by elevated mortality and disability rates due to persistent infections resulting from refractory wounds. Currently, effective treatment strategies are lacking. Adipose-derived stem cell extracellular vesicles (ADSC-EVs) have been shown to promote skin wound healing; however, their clinical application is impeded by low yield and heterogeneity. We successfully isolated high-yield extruded nanovesicles from adipose stem cells (ADSC-NVs), achieving yields over 30 times greater than those of ADSC-EVs while maintaining similar morphological characteristics. Our findings indicate that ADSC-NVs exhibit a dose-dependent enhancement of proliferation and migration in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) in vitro. Notably, the expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), collagen type I (COL-I), and collagen type III (COL-III) were significantly upregulated in HDF following treatment with ADSC-NVs. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between the ADSC-NVs group and control group were predominantly enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway. Consistently, ADSC-NVs facilitate efficient diabetic wound healing while promoting proliferation and inhibiting inflammation via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, high-yield ADSC-NVs represent a promising alternative to ADSC-EVs for enhancing diabetic wound healing, providing novel insights and methodologies for improving therapeutic outcomes."
GSE307815,Diabetes-associated MYT1 and ST18 regulate human b-cell insulin secretion and survival via other diabetes-risk genes,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,3,307815,,2025/10/10,"Genetic and environmental factors together cause islet beta-cell failure, leading to Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we study how two members of the Myelin transcription factor family (MYT1, MYT1L, and ST18) prevent human beta-cell failure under obesity-related stress. We have reported that these factors are induced by high levels of obesity-related nutrients. They prevent beta-cell failure in mouse islets and human beta-cell lines. Their variants are all associated with human T2D, and their downregulation accompanies beta-cell dysfunction during T2D development. By knocking down MYT1 or ST18 separately in primary human donor islets, we show here that they have overlapping but distinct functions. Under normal culture conditions, MYT1-knockdown (KD) causes beta-cell death, while ST18-KD compromises glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Under obesity-induced metabolic stress in vivo, ST18-KD also causes beta-cell death. These findings led us to explore the molecular mechanisms by which MUYT1/ST18 regulate beta cells. The data presented here are the RNAseq of human islet beta cells with knockdown of these factors."
GSE303447,Novel molecular signatures of peripheral Regulatory T Cells in Kidney Disease associated with Type 1 Diabetes,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,30,303447,,2025/10/01,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D). T1D and some kidney disorders are often associated with abnormalities in regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, it is unknown if Treg subsets, and their molecular architecture are altered during the onset and progression of DKD in T1D. We addressed this critical knowledge gap by characterising changes in Tregs isolated from 31 participants (10 control, 13 with T1D, and 8 T1D with albuminuria) using flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and microRNA profiling. We identified that the effector and central memory Tregs were significantly different between groups. Similarly, multiple gene transcripts were also significantly different between groups that also overlapped with other publicly available datasets. Machine-learning based data analyses discovered a set of important microRNAs associated with clinical eGFR values. Importantly, our analyses identified two differentially expressed Treg ligand genes (LRRC4B, TGM2), which interacted with the receptors on kidney cells (PTPRD/F/S, ADGRG1) in silico, providing potential mechanistic insights into the role of Tregs in DKD progression. Together, our work supports the yet unappreciated role of Tregs in DKD and opens new research avenues to further consolidate their causal relationship."
GSE309294,Human pancreatic ductal cells from non-T1D donors respond to T1D cytokines and function as non-professional antigen presenting cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,12,309294,,2025/09/30,"Aims/Hypothesis: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease marked by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreatic islets, with an incomplete picture of disease pathogenesis/progression and a lack of definitive cure. A recent finding linked pancreatic ductal cells of T1D donors with elevated levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II molecules; however, the causal relationship and functional significance of this finding remain unknown. Because HLA Class II molecules are typically expressed by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), this raises the possibility of ductal cells functioning as non-professional APCs. In this study, we test the hypothesis that non-T1D ductal cells are responsive to T1D-associated proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, and can act as non-professional APCs. Methods: Pancreatic exocrine cells, after the removal of islets, were obtained from cadaveric donors without apparent diseases and with appropriate consent. Cells were cryopreserved, thawed into a defined culture medium tailored to support ductal cell survival in a 3D suspension culture system. Ductal cells were exposed to various doses of cytokines for 48 hours and analyzed for gene and protein expression, using qRT-PCR, bulk-RNAseq, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. Functional ability of cytokine-treated ductal cells to present an exogenous autoantigen (glutamate decarboxylase 65kD isoform [GAD65]) to T cells was tested using a GAD65-specific autoreactive CD4+ T cell clone (named BRI4.13) isolated from a T1D donor. Results: We found that within 48 hours a combination of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ stimulated the expression of HLA Class II, co-stimulatory, and antigen-processing molecules at mRNA and protein levels in non-T1D ductal cells. Bulk RNAseq analysis showed that cytokines most significantly upregulated biological pathways in “antigen processing and presentation” and “T1D”. When cytokine-treated ductal cells were pulsed with an exogenous GAD65 peptide and cocultured with the BRI4.13 T cells, these T cells became activated and proliferated. Unexpectedly, we also found ~1% of KRT19+ ductal cells express GAD protein endogenously. Conclusions/interpretation: These results demonstrate that non-diseased primary ductal cells are sensitive to TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ stimulation, and can upregulate APC molecules and function in antigen presentation to autoreactive CD4+ T cells. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence demonstrating antigen presentation by non-T1D human ductal cells to T cells, which implicate ductal cells in contributing to T1D progression."
GSE290559,Effect of Ref-1 redox inhibition with APX2009 on gene expression in human retinal endothelial cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,10,290559,,2025/09/24,"Ischemic retinopathies, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), are characterized by abnormal retinal neovascularization. Current therapeutic interventions for these diseases include intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF biologics, which face multiple limitations due to variable patient response and utilization of alternative pathways to promote angiogenesis. APE1/Ref-1, a protein with both DNA endonuclease and redox regulatory functions, may be a novel therpautic target for proliferative retinopathies, because the redox function of Ref-1 modulates multiple signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation. Here, we aimed to identify novel signaling pathways regulated by Ref-1 redox activity using RNA sequencing of human retinal endothelial cells treated with Ref-1 redox inhibitor APX2009."
GSE307925,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy subtypes defined by immune defense and endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,12,307925,,2025/09/19,"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major complication of diabetes characterized by pathological angiogenesis in the retina. Standard treatment includes vitrectomy to remove these abnormal vessels, and the resulting clinical specimens provide an opportunity to define drivers of PDR. Here, we profiled endothelial and immune cells from such samples to identify disease mechanisms. In some patients, endothelial cells were more abundant, whereas in others, immune cells predominated. Immune cells exhibit gene expression programs directed against pathological endothelium, suggesting an endogenous defense that may explain the scarcity of endothelial cells in certain cases. Preoperative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy altered transcriptional programs in both endothelial and immune cells, indicating that its effects extend beyond the vasculature. A comparison of endothelial signatures from PDR patients and nondiabetic donor retinas revealed a distinct molecular program in PDR, prominently marked by mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, endothelial cells from the murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model lacked mitochondrial dysfunction, although other features of pathological angiogenesis were shared. These findings suggest that PDR is not a uniform disease but comprises distinct types characterized by either immune-mediated clearance of pathological vessels or endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction. They also revealed that anti-VEGF therapy influences both endothelial and immune compartments, with implications for treatment strategies. Finally, the data clarify both the relevance and limitations of the OIR model for preclinical testing of new therapeutic targets."
GSE236379,Hypoxia Triggers Signatures of Maladaptive Repair in Human Kidney Organoids [bulk RNA-seq],Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,12,236379,,2025/08/15,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over half of all adults over 70 and 13% of the global population. The development of renal fibrosis is strongly correlated with loss of kidney function during CKD and involves cellular injury, excessive production of extracellular matrix proteins and inflammation. Current treatments focus on controlling blood pressure, controlling diabetes, and steroid therapies; however, we have no treatments to suppress renal fibrosis. Because hypoxia plays a key role in the development and progression of CKD, we have developed a new model of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids to study in vitro the development of fibrosis in a human model."
GSE302939,DEC1 Regulates Human β Cell Functional Maturation and Circadian Rhythm,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,17,302939,,2025/07/24,"Stem cell-derived islet (SC-islet) organoids offer hope for cell replacement therapy in diabetes, but their immature function remains a challenge. Mature islet function requires the β-cell circadian clock, yet how the clock regulates maturation is unclear. Here, we show that a circadian transcription factor specific to maturing SC-β cells, DEC1, regulates insulin responsiveness to glucose. SC-islet organoids form normally from DEC1-ablated human pluripotent stem cells, but their insulin release capacity and glucose threshold fail to increase during in vitro culture and upon transplant. This deficit reflects downregulation of maturity-linked effectors of glucose utilization and insulin exocytosis, blunting glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and is rescued by increasing metabolic flux. Moreover, DEC1 is needed to boost SC-islet maturity by synchronizing circadian glucose-responsive insulin secretion rhythms and clock machinery. Thus, DEC1 links circadian control to human β-cell maturation, highlighting its vitality to foster fully functional SC-islets."
GSE302658,Evaluation of a novel chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-antagonist in painful diabetic polyneuropathy,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,205,302658,,2025/07/16,"Background and aims: Preclinical data suggest that the chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is involved in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain through modulation of neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and activation of spinal cord microglia. CCR2-antagonists have shown to be effective in preclinical models of neuropathic pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efﬁcacy, safety and tolerability of a novel CCR2-antagonist, AZD2423, in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN).  Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multi-center study in patients with sym- metric distal sensory polyneuropathy due to type 1 or 2 diabetes and duration of neuropathic pain between 3 months and 5 years. Concomitant treatment with neuropathic pain medications (e.g. anticon- vulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-noradrenaline uptake inhibitors, opioids, topical lidocaine or capsaicin) was not allowed. 134 patients with PDN were equally randomized to 28 days oral admin- istration of 20 mg AZD2423, 150 mg AZD2423, or placebo. The primary efﬁcacy variable was the change of average pain score from 5-days baseline to the last 5 days of treatment, measured with numerical rating scale (NRS, 0–10). The secondary efﬁcacy measures included NRS worst pain scores, patient global impression of change, pain interference on sleep and activity, and neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI).  Results: The change of NRS average pain score was not signiﬁcantly different between treatment groups (AZD2423 20 mg: −1.50; AZD2423 150 mg: −1.35; placebo: −1.61). The NPSI total score and three out of ﬁve subscores (evoked pain, pressing/deep pain and paresthesia/dysesthesia) tended to be reduced more by AZD2423 150 mg than by placebo. No other secondary efﬁcacy variables differed between treatment groups. The frequency and type of adverse events for AZD2423 were similar to placebo. The achieved plasma levels of AZD2423 in the two dose groups were in line with predictions from pharmacokinetic data previously obtained in healthy volunteers. Dose-dependent increase of plasma levels of the ligand of CCR2 (CCL2; chemokine ligand 2) and decrease of the mean levels of monocytes (−27% by AZD2423 150 mg) suggested that the administrated doses of AZD2423 interacted with the CCR2 target.  Conclusion: The CCR2-antagonist AZD2423 showed no analgesic efﬁcacy in PDN based on NRS average pain scores and global and functional pain outcome measures. The NPSI data suggested possible effects on certain sensory components of pain. There were no major safety or tolerability concerns."
