GSE317266,Energy-sensing molecule RORγ regulates Cholesterol Metabolism and Immune Signaling in Diabetic Kidney Disease and Aging,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,6,317266,,2026/01/22,"Aging is a major risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), with both conditions exhibiting similar renal pathology. We identify the energy-sensing molecule Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) as significantly downregulated in diabetic and aged kidneys. Tubule-specific RORγ deficiency exacerbates kidney injury, whereas its overexpression protects. Mechanistically, RORγ stabilizes insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) by upregulating the deubiquitinase YOD1 and enhancing AMPK activity via CAB39, which together promote INSIG1 phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization. Stabilized INSIG1 potently blocks the ER-to-Golgi transport and activation of SREBP2 (cholesterol synthesis) and STING (inflammatory signaling). In diabetes, RORγ itself is suppressed transcriptionally by CTCF and functionally by impaired AMPK/SIRT1 signaling, which hinders its activation. Importantly, administration of a RORγ agonist or RORγ-enriched exosomes effectively alleviates diabetic kidney injury. Thus, RORγ emerges as a key regulatory node that mitigates DKD and renal aging by co-regulating AMPK-mediated metabolic and STING-driven innate immune pathways through INSIG1 stabilization."
GSE309688,Natural daylight during office hours improves glucose control and whole-body substrate metabolism,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,48,309688,,2026/01/06,"Chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). In a randomized cross-over design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with T2D were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted towards a greater reliance on fat oxidation upon daylight. In vitro assessment of the muscle clock displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure during office hours has a positive metabolic impact in individuals with T2D and could potentially support the treatment of metabolic diseases."
GSE311535,RNA-seq of human atherosclerotic carotid plaque tissue from diabetic patients,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,12,311535,,2025/12/17,"Diabetes Mellitus is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarctions and strokes due to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development and rupture. The mechanisms driving plaque rupture in the diabetic setting remain unclear. We sequenced ribosome-depleted total RNA from carotid plaques obtained from diabetic subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy with high-grade stenosis, who either recently experienced a carotid-related ischemic cerebrovascular event (Symptomatic, n=6) or had no such event (Asymptomatic, n=6). Principal component analysis of the most variable transcripts demonstrated that sex and insulin use, rather than plaque rupture status, were the major contributors to the variability in the dataset. Hierarchical clustering further highlighted the importance of these factors in the dataset but also included two clusters whose expression was elevated in the symptomatic group. These clusters were enriched with transcripts for immunoglobulins and matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting increased B-cell infiltration and extracellular matrix degradation in the symptomatic plaques. We identified only two transcripts, RNU2-1 and PI4KAP1, as significantly up-regulated in the symptomatic group. We identified 35 transcripts with altered expression in subjects on insulin therapy, including regulators of B-cells (MZB1), T cells (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3, CD96, and CTSW), and macrophages (MPEG1). Next, we used spatial deconvolution to focus on differentially expressed genes in the fibrous cap of the carotid plaques. In the symptomatic group, we identified elevated levels of five angiogenesis-associated transcripts (ALS2CL, EPHB4, SMAD1, PREX2, EFNA5), suggesting increased intraplaque neovascularization in ruptured plaques. Thus, insulin use significantly impacts the transcriptome of atherosclerotic plaques, promoting vascular inflammation."
GSE260717,Proteogenomic discovery of novel open reading frames with HLA immune presentation on human beta cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease only,True,supplementary,18,260717,,2025/12/09,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) provides a comprehensive view of translational regulation, crucial for understanding cellular processes. Here, we applied Ribo-seq to map the translatome of human stem cell-derived beta cells (sBCs). Our analysis revealed close to 1000 novel open reading frames (nuORFs) in sBCs, with a majority showing protein-level support, suggesting functional relevance. Furthermore, we detected an immunogenic peptide, INS-DRiP, originating from an alternative start site in INS mRNA. Comparison with primary human islets highlighted beta cell specificity of the identified nuORFs. Notably, we identified a regulatory upstream ORF within TYK2, a gene implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and crucial for beta cell function and interferon response. Our findings underscore the importance translational regulation in beta cell function and its implications in T1D."
GSE311533,Lamin A/C regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation: insights from models of familial partial lipodystrophy 2 sub1,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,supplementary,14,311533,,2025/12/01,"Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, and metabolic dysfunction. FPLD2 is caused by pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear lamins A/C, structural proteins that control nuclear function and gene expression. However, the mechanisms driving adipocyte loss in FPLD2 remain poorly defined. In this study, we recruited eight families with developing or established FPLD2 and performed clinical, histological, and transcriptomic analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed suppression of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways, alongside increased inflammation. These signatures were mirrored in tamoxifen-inducible adipocyte-specific Lmna knockout mice, in which lamin A/C-deficient adipocytes shrank and disappeared. Lmna-deficient fibroblasts shared similar gene expression changes, linked to altered chromatin accessibility, underscoring lamin A/C’s potential regulatory role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory programs. By directly comparing atrophic and hypertrophic adipose depots in FPLD2, and integrating human, mouse, and in vitro models, this study provides new insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets."
GSE273001,Integrative RNA-seq and CLIP-seq analysis reveals hnRNP-F regulation of the TNFα/NFκB signaling in high glucose conditions,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Unclear,True,supplementary,6,273001,,2025/11/13,"Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq we found that we found that hnRNP-F may bind to lncRNA SNHG1 to negatively regulate the transcription of genes involved in the TNFα/NFκB signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Our study suggests that hnRNP-F may play a role in diabetic nephropathy by regulating the differential expression and variable splicing of diabetic nephropathy-associated genes, especially those related to inflammatory response."
