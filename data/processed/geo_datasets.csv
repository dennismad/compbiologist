GSE232764,TBCRC 039: A phase II study of preoperative ruxolitinib with or without paclitaxel for triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Treated vs Untreated,True,supplementary,17,GSE232764,38297352,2024-02-07,"We conducted a randomized phase II study with nested window-of-opportunity in patients with TN-IBC. Patients were randomized to receive a 7-day run-in of ruxolitinib (RUX) alone or ruxolitinib plus paclitaxel (RUX+PAC) in a 1:2 ratio, followed by 12 weeks of neoadjuvant paclitaxel alone or in combination with ruxolitinib in a 1:2 ratio. All patients subsequently received 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide, followed by modified radical mastectomy. Patients provided tumor tissue from research biopsies performed at baseline (pre-run-in) and after the completion of run-in therapy. Tumor tissue was evaluated for phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence, and a subset of cases were also analyze by RNA-seq. The primary objective was to evaluate the percent of patients whose tumors were pSTAT3-positive at baseline, and which subsequently became pSTAT3-negative after run-in therapy. Secondary endpoints included pathologic complete response (pCR), residual tumor burden (RCB) and event-free survival (EFS) from the date of surgery. There were 23 patients enrolled, 11 in RUX and 12 in RUX+PAC combination. The most common adverse events were fatigue and nausea. Two patients achieved pCR and 21 completed pre-operative therapy. We detected a decrease in pSTAT3 and IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways in post-run-in biopsies of RUX-treated samples, but this did not correlate with pCR, while RUX+PAC upregulated IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling. Both treatments decreased GZM+ T cells implying immune suppression, which might have contributed to lack of efficacy."
GSE232175,MAF Amplification licenses Estrogen Receptor α to Drive Breast Cancer Metastasis [dataset 1],Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,fast_metadata_predicted,24,GSE232175,,2023-09-15,"We performed mRNA profiling of control and MAF-overexpressing MCF7 cells to assess the transcriptional consequences of estrogen receptor (ER) activation upon metastatic MAF expression in the presence or absence or ER (using a protac for ER degradation). To this end, we cultured MCF7 cells in hormone-deprived (HD) medium for 72 h. At this point, we treated the cells with vehice or ER-protac for 24h and then estrogen (E2) or vehicle was added for 6h prior to RNA extraction. Samples were generated in triplicate. We report that MAF supports the expression of genes involved in metastatic functions and that E2 treatment and ER expression correlates with E2 early and late gene responses and cell cycle regulation. Additionally, a set of MAF and ER-dependent gene responses was identified. Our results show that MAF expression causes an expansion of ER-mediated transcriptional events in MCF7 cells exposed to E2."

DSC1 was previously associated with lymph node metastasis of luminal A breast tumors and was found to increase metastatic potential of MCF7 cells in vitro.;	Therefore, we focused on DSC1 role in cellular and molecular mechanisms in luminal A breast cancer and its possible therapeutic modulation using parthenolide.;	We performed comparative gene expression analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of DSC1-overexpressing and control cells treated and untreated with parthenolide in biological duplicates."
GSE236280,HER3 targeting augments the efficacy of panobinostat in claudin-low triple-negative breast cancer cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Treated vs Untreated,True,fast_metadata_predicted,6,GSE236280,,2023-07-05,"Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a poor prognosis and high relapse rate due to limited therapeutic options. This study was conducted to determine the mechanisms of action of panobinostat, a pan-inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and FDA-approved medication for multiple myeloma, in TNBC and to provide a rationale for effective drug combinations against this aggressive disease. RNA sequencing analyses of the claudin-low (CL) TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cells untreated or treated with panobinostat were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes. Adaptive alterations in gene expression were analyzed and validated in additional CL TNBC cells. Tumor xenograft models were used to test the in vivo antitumor activity of panobinostat alone or its combinations with gefitinib, an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Panobinostat potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in all TNBC cells tested. However, in CL TNBC cells, this HDAC inhibitor markedly enhanced expression of HER3, which interacted with EGFR to activate both receptors and Akt signaling pathways. Combinations of panobinostat and gefitinib synergistically suppressed CL TNBC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of HER3 compromises the efficacy of panobinostat in CL TNBC. Inactivation of HER3 combined with panobinostat represents a practical approach to combat CL TNBC."

GSE212690,Beneficial effects of mifepristone treatment in breast cancer patients selected by the progesterone receptor isoform ratio: Results from the MIPRA trial,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Treated vs Untreated,True,supplementary,16,GSE212690,36269797,2023-01-16,"Background: Preclinical data suggest that antiprogestins inhibit the growth of luminal breast carcinomas expressing higher levels of progesterone receptor isoform A (PRA) than isoform B (PRB). Thus, we designed a pre-surgical window of opportunity trial to determine the therapeutic effects of mifepristone in breast cancer patients selected by their high PRA/PRB isoform ratio (MIPRA; NCT02651844). Patients and Methods. Twenty patients bearing luminal breast carcinomas with PRA/PRB>1.5 (determined by Western blots), and PR ≥50%, naive from previous treatment, were included for mifepristone treatment (200 mg/day p.o.; 14 days). Core needle biopsies (CNB) and surgical samples were formalin-fixed for immunohistochemical studies, and others were snap-frozen to perform RNA-Seq, proteomics, and/or Western blots studies. Plasma mifepristone levels were determined by mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was the comparison of Ki-67 expression pre- and post-treatment. Results: A 49.62% decrease in Ki-67 staining was registered in all surgical specimens compared to baseline (p=0.0003). Using the pre-specified response parameter (30% relative reduction) we identified 14/20 responders. Mifepristone induced gland differentiation, an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a decrease in hormone receptors and pSer118ER expression, and an increase in calregulin, p21, p15, and activated caspase3 expression. RNA-Seq and proteomics studies identified downregulated pathways related to cell proliferation and upregulation of those related to immune bioprocesses and extracellular matrix re-modeling pathways. Conclusion: Our results support the use of mifepristone in luminal breast cancer patients with high PRA/PRB ratios. The combined effects of mifepristone with estrogen receptor modulators deserves clinic evaluation in these patients, to improve endocrine treatment responsiveness."

GSE189495,Fractionated irradiation of breast cancer cells rewires a gene regulatory circuit towards a treatment-resistant stemness phenotype,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Treated vs Untreated,True,fast_metadata_predicted,9,GSE189495,35579852,2022-10-12,"Radiotherapy is a potent component of the standard of care for breast cancer. However, surviving radioresistant cells can repopulate following treatment and provoke relapse. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of radiation resistance may help improve treatment of radioresistant tumours. To emulate radiation therapy at the cellular level, we exposed MCF7 breast cancer cells to daily radiation doses of 2 Gy up to an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Fractionally irradiated cells (FIR20) displayed increased clonogenic survival and population doubling time as compared to age-matched sham-irradiated cells and untreated, parental MCF7 cells. RNA-sequencing revealed a core signature of 229 mRNAs and 7 circRNAs significantly altered in the FIR20 cells. The FIR20 cell transcriptome overlapped significantly with canonical radiation signatures, and demonstrated a remarkable commonality with radiation and endocrine therapy resistance expression profiles, suggesting crosstalk between both acquired resistance pathways. Using predictive analyses and functional enrichment, we identified a gene-regulatory network of circRNA and mRNA that promotes stemness and inflammatory signaling in FIR20 cells. We propose that these phenotypic traits render breast cancer cells more radioresistant and may therefore serve as potential modules for combination therapies."

GSE184452,Fasting Mimicking Diet blocks breast cancer and cancer stem cells escape,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Disease vs Healthy,True,fast_metadata_predicted,12,GSE184452,34731655,2022-01-27,"Metastatic tumors remain lethal due to primary/acquired resistance to therapy or cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated repopulation. We show that a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) activates starvation escape pathways in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which can be identified and targeted by drugs. In CSCs, FMD cycles lower glucose-dependent protein kinase A signaling and stemness markers to reduce cell number and increase mouse survival. Accordingly, metastatic TNBC patients with lower glycemia survive longer than those with higher baseline glycemia. By contrast, in differentiated cancer cells, FMD cycles activate PI3K-AKT, mTOR and CDK4/6 as survival/growth pathways, which can be targeted by drugs to promote tumor regression. FMD cycles also prevent hyperglycemia and other toxicities caused by these drugs. These data indicate that FMD has wide and differential effects on normal, cancer and cancer stem cells, allowing the rapid identification and targeting of starvation escape pathways and providing a method potentially applicable to many malignancies."

GSE163067,IFNγ modulates the immunopeptidome of triple negative breast cancer cells by enhancing and diversifying antigen processing and presentation,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,Treated vs Untreated,True,fast_metadata_predicted,6,GSE163067,33968037,2021-09-09,"To identify potential T-cell targets for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) vaccination, we examined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) on the transcriptome, proteome and immunopeptidome of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 84,131 peptides from 9,647 source proteins presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles. Treatment with IFNγ resulted in a remarkable remoulding of the immunopeptidome, with only a 34% overlap between untreated and treated cells across the HLA-I immunopeptidome, and expression of HLA-II only on treated cells. IFNγ increased the overall number, diversity and abundance of the immunopeptidome, as well as the proportion of coverage of source antigens. The suite of peptides displayed under conditions of IFNγ treatment included many known tumour associated antigens, with the HLA-II repertoire sampling 265 breast cancer associated antigens absent from those sampled by HLA-I. Quantitative analysis of the transcriptome (10,248 transcripts) and proteome (6783 proteins) of these cells revealed 229 proteins and transcripts were commonly differentially  expressed, most of which involved in downstream targets of IFNγ signalling including components of the antigen processing machinery such as tapasin and HLA. However, these changes in protein expression did not explain the dramatic modulation of the immunopeptidome following IFNγ treatment.  These results demonstrate the high degree of plasticity in the immunopeptidome TNBC cells following cytokine stimulation and provide evidence that under pro-inflammatory conditions a greater variety of HLA-I and HLA-II vaccine targets are unveiled to the immune system. This has important implications for the development of personalised cancer vaccination strategies."
