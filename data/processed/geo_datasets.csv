GSE317266,Energy-sensing molecule RORγ regulates Cholesterol Metabolism and Immune Signaling in Diabetic Kidney Disease and Aging,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,6,317266,,2026/01/22,"Aging is a major risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD), with both conditions exhibiting similar renal pathology. We identify the energy-sensing molecule Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) as significantly downregulated in diabetic and aged kidneys. Tubule-specific RORγ deficiency exacerbates kidney injury, whereas its overexpression protects. Mechanistically, RORγ stabilizes insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) by upregulating the deubiquitinase YOD1 and enhancing AMPK activity via CAB39, which together promote INSIG1 phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization. Stabilized INSIG1 potently blocks the ER-to-Golgi transport and activation of SREBP2 (cholesterol synthesis) and STING (inflammatory signaling). In diabetes, RORγ itself is suppressed transcriptionally by CTCF and functionally by impaired AMPK/SIRT1 signaling, which hinders its activation. Importantly, administration of a RORγ agonist or RORγ-enriched exosomes effectively alleviates diabetic kidney injury. Thus, RORγ emerges as a key regulatory node that mitigates DKD and renal aging by co-regulating AMPK-mediated metabolic and STING-driven innate immune pathways through INSIG1 stabilization."
GSE297587,iCLIP analysis of full-length and deletion mutants of myc-LARP6,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,30,297587,,2026/01/22,"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are prevalent in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), yet their roles in RNA interactions remain poorly defined. We examined the structured and disordered RNA-binding activities of LARP6, an RBP with a diverse RNA-binding repertoire. U87 glioblastoma cells stably expressing myc-tagged full-length or various deletion mutants of LARP6 under a doxycycline switch were induced to express myc-LARP6 variants at near endogenous levels, before individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) was performed to assess each variants' RNA-binding targets on the transcriptome. A total RNA-seq experiment was also performed on the cells in parallel to distinguish between changes in RNA bidning and those that are affected via expression level variations."
GSE309688,Natural daylight during office hours improves glucose control and whole-body substrate metabolism,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,48,309688,,2026/01/06,"Chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). In a randomized cross-over design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with T2D were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted towards a greater reliance on fat oxidation upon daylight. In vitro assessment of the muscle clock displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure during office hours has a positive metabolic impact in individuals with T2D and could potentially support the treatment of metabolic diseases."
GSE283452,HUMAN ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGE FUNCTION IS IMPAIRED IN TUBERCULOSIS CONTACTS WITH DIABETES,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,89,283452,,2025/12/31,"Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are more susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection and severe tuberculosis (TB). The underlying mechanisms contributing to this remain largely unknown. To fill this critical knowledge gap, we obtained human alveolar macrophages (HAMs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from TB-exposed individuals with and without T2D in South Africa. We infected HAMs and MDMs ex vivo with live M.tb then collected RNA for RNAseq after 2, 24, 72h."
GSE263483,Effects of intrauterine hyperglycemia on offspring development in gestational diabetes mellitus based on placental transcriptomics,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,16,263483,,2025/12/30,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) refers to diabetes diagnosed as diabetes in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, but not obvious before pregnancy. It is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, which can lead to perinatal asphyxia, neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia, cardiovascular abnormalities, obesity and other short-term and long-term adverse outcomes of the offspring. This study explores the differential expression of transcriptome between GDM and non GDM placenta, and explores the impact of subtle metabolic changes in the placenta on fetal growth and development during GDM in pregnant women."
GSE314698,Pancreatic volume and immunological biomarkers predict checkpoint inhibitor-associated autoimmune diabetes in humans.,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,83,314698,,2025/12/26,"Background: Checkpoint inhibitor-associated autoimmune diabetes (CIADM) is a rare but life-altering complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Biomarkers that predict type 1 diabetes (T1D) are unreliable for CIADM. Aim To identify biomarkers for prediction of CIADM. Methods: From our prospective biobank, 14 CIADM patients who had metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1±anti CTLA4 were identified. Controls were selected from the same biobank, matched 2:1. Pre-treatment, on-ICI and post-CIADM serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed. Serum was analysed for T1D autoantibodies, C-peptide, glucose and cytokines. PBMCs were profiled using flow cytometry. Pancreatic volume was measured using CT volumetry. Results: Before treatment, CIADM patients had smaller pancreatic volume (27% reduction, p=0.044) and higher anti-GAD antibody titres (median 2.9 versus 0, p=0.01). They had significantly higher baseline proportions of Th17 helper cells (p=0.03), higher CD4+ central memory cells (p=0.04) and lower naïve CD4+ cells (p=0.01). With ICI treatment, greater declines in pancreatic volume were seen in CIADM patients (p<0.0001). Activated CD4+ subsets increased significantly in CIADM and controls with immune-related adverse effects (IRAE) but not controls without IRAE. Using only pre-treatment results, pancreatic volume, anti-GAD antibody titre and baseline immune flow profile were highly predictive of CIADM development, with an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.96. Conclusions: People who develop CIADM are immunologically predisposed and have antecedent pancreatic and immunological changes that accurately predict disease with excellent sensitivity. These biomarkers could be used to guide ICI use, particularly when planning treatment for low-risk tumours."
GSE311535,RNA-seq of human atherosclerotic carotid plaque tissue from diabetic patients,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,12,311535,,2025/12/17,"Diabetes Mellitus is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarctions and strokes due to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque development and rupture. The mechanisms driving plaque rupture in the diabetic setting remain unclear. We sequenced ribosome-depleted total RNA from carotid plaques obtained from diabetic subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy with high-grade stenosis, who either recently experienced a carotid-related ischemic cerebrovascular event (Symptomatic, n=6) or had no such event (Asymptomatic, n=6). Principal component analysis of the most variable transcripts demonstrated that sex and insulin use, rather than plaque rupture status, were the major contributors to the variability in the dataset. Hierarchical clustering further highlighted the importance of these factors in the dataset but also included two clusters whose expression was elevated in the symptomatic group. These clusters were enriched with transcripts for immunoglobulins and matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting increased B-cell infiltration and extracellular matrix degradation in the symptomatic plaques. We identified only two transcripts, RNU2-1 and PI4KAP1, as significantly up-regulated in the symptomatic group. We identified 35 transcripts with altered expression in subjects on insulin therapy, including regulators of B-cells (MZB1), T cells (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3, CD96, and CTSW), and macrophages (MPEG1). Next, we used spatial deconvolution to focus on differentially expressed genes in the fibrous cap of the carotid plaques. In the symptomatic group, we identified elevated levels of five angiogenesis-associated transcripts (ALS2CL, EPHB4, SMAD1, PREX2, EFNA5), suggesting increased intraplaque neovascularization in ruptured plaques. Thus, insulin use significantly impacts the transcriptome of atherosclerotic plaques, promoting vascular inflammation."
GSE296196,Enhancement of activation-induced T cell proliferation by SIRPG in a CD47-independent manner,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,46,296196,,2025/12/10,"SIRPG, a primate-specific type 1 transmembrane protein in the Signal Regulatory Protein (SIRP) family, is predominantly expressed in T cells. It contains a short cytoplasmic domain, which does not contain any known signaling motif, and its only known ligand is CD47. Several genetic variations in SIRPG, including the V263A (rs6043409) polymorphism, linked to increased type 1 diabetes risk, highlight its potential importance. However, its expression and physiological role remain largely unclear due to its absence in rodents. Here, we demonstrate that SIRPG and GzmB exhibit near mutually exclusive expression in resting peripheral CD8+ T cells. We further show that SIRPG serves as a valuable marker for GzmK-expressing CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and inflamed synovial fluid and that its expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is upregulated by anti-CD3 stimulation, with further enhancement by the TNFα inhibitor adalimumab, but not certolizumab. While SIRPG ablation minimally affects T cell activation and IFNγ/TNFα production, it impairs the expression of mitosis-regulating genes like UBE2C and TOP2A, leading to reduced proliferation, and alters the expression of certain activation-induced surface molecules, including CRTAM. Notably, SIRPG-mediated proliferation and CRTAM expression are cell-autonomous and CD47-independent. Structural and functional analyses reveal that SIRPG-driven proliferation is independent of its extracellular D1 domain, not significantly affected by the V263 variant, but dependent on its cytoplasmic domain. Collectively, our findings offer novel insights into the expression, function, and mechanism of action of SIRPG in T cells."
GSE260717,Proteogenomic discovery of novel open reading frames with HLA immune presentation on human beta cells,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,18,260717,,2025/12/09,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) provides a comprehensive view of translational regulation, crucial for understanding cellular processes. Here, we applied Ribo-seq to map the translatome of human stem cell-derived beta cells (sBCs). Our analysis revealed close to 1000 novel open reading frames (nuORFs) in sBCs, with a majority showing protein-level support, suggesting functional relevance. Furthermore, we detected an immunogenic peptide, INS-DRiP, originating from an alternative start site in INS mRNA. Comparison with primary human islets highlighted beta cell specificity of the identified nuORFs. Notably, we identified a regulatory upstream ORF within TYK2, a gene implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and crucial for beta cell function and interferon response. Our findings underscore the importance translational regulation in beta cell function and its implications in T1D."
GSE301956,Identification of Circulating miRNA Alterations in Diabetes Patients Excluding Periodontitis Effects: Insights into Target Gene Downregulation in Diabetic Complications,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,43,301956,,2025/12/04,"Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, we analyzed plasma exosomal miRNAs from normal individuals and patients with PD or PD combined with diabetes (PDDM). Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using small RNA-seq, and their target genes were validated using bulk RNA-seq datasets from tissues related to diabetic complications. Analysis of target genes revealed biologically meaningful pathways that were consistently involved across affected tissues, providing insight into systemic miRNA–mRNA regulation in diabetes."
GSE311533,Lamin A/C regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation: insights from models of familial partial lipodystrophy 2 sub1,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,14,311533,,2025/12/01,"Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is a rare disease characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, and metabolic dysfunction. FPLD2 is caused by pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear lamins A/C, structural proteins that control nuclear function and gene expression. However, the mechanisms driving adipocyte loss in FPLD2 remain poorly defined. In this study, we recruited eight families with developing or established FPLD2 and performed clinical, histological, and transcriptomic analyses of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing revealed suppression of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial pathways, alongside increased inflammation. These signatures were mirrored in tamoxifen-inducible adipocyte-specific Lmna knockout mice, in which lamin A/C-deficient adipocytes shrank and disappeared. Lmna-deficient fibroblasts shared similar gene expression changes, linked to altered chromatin accessibility, underscoring lamin A/C’s potential regulatory role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory programs. By directly comparing atrophic and hypertrophic adipose depots in FPLD2, and integrating human, mouse, and in vitro models, this study provides new insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets."

GSE284583,Pan-modification profiling facilitates a cross-evolutionary dissection of the thermoregulated ribosomal epitranscriptome - HsapiScere,Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,34,284583,,2025/11/13,"Over 170 modifications are deposited on RNA, across the tree of life. A major bottleneck to systematically dissecting RNA modifications has been the lack of methods allowing to acquire systematic, high-confidence maps of many RNA modifications and at scale. Here we have developed Pan-Mod-seq, which permits de-novo, sensitive and specific identification of 16 distinct modifications in dozens of samples in parallel. We applied Pan-Mod-seq to RNA from 14 different species from all 3 domains of life, most of which sampled under highly variable chemical/physical/biological gradients, aiming to systematically explore the plasticity of rRNA modifications. While dynamically modified sites are relatively rare in mesophiles, we find that these are widespread in hyperthermophiles, where ~50% of identified modifications were induced with temperature. We focused on dissection of three key dynamically induced modifications: m5C, ac4C and Ψ. We uncover an m5C program encompassing dozens of targets across both rRNA subunits, all of which are dramatically induced with growth temperature in two of the sampled hyperthermophiles. In both cases m5C is introduced at a single consensus motif, via a single enzyme which is essential for growth at higher temperatures. ac4C in turn is dynamically induced among all three sampled hyperthermophiles at hundreds of sites, also at a single consensus motif. Remarkably, the methylation and acetylation overlap, and together form a tandemly modified temperature induced G-m5C-ac4C-G sequence motif.  Temperature-dependent induction of both enzymes can be recapitulated in vitro, establishing that it is an intrinsic property of the two enzymes rather than externally regulated. We obtain high-resolution cryoEM structures of ribosomes from WT strains at low and high temperatures and ones deleted of the methylating enzyme, and identify numerous mechanisms via which m5C confers structural stability. Finally, we also uncover a systematic induction in Ψ levels in T. kodakarensis, and reveal that it is largely coordinated by a single temperature-induced sRNA guiding pseudouridine formation at an unprecedented number of targets, whose loss results in growth deficiency at higher temperatures. Our findings offer a wide and systematic view of rRNA modification plasticity across representative species sampled from the tree of life, dissect the ability of different modifications to contribute to the stability of ribosomes at higher temperatures, and present a methodology allowing an unprecedented view on the the rRNA epitranscriptome in health and in disease."

GSE273001,Integrative RNA-seq and CLIP-seq analysis reveals hnRNP-F regulation of the TNFα/NFκB signaling in high glucose conditions,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq,6,273001,,2025/11/13,"Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq we found that we found that hnRNP-F may bind to lncRNA SNHG1 to negatively regulate the transcription of genes involved in the TNFα/NFκB signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Our study suggests that hnRNP-F may play a role in diabetic nephropathy by regulating the differential expression and variable splicing of diabetic nephropathy-associated genes, especially those related to inflammatory response."
